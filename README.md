# Social-Network
A Social Network made in Java: within the subject Advanced Programming Methods from year 2 semester 1, Babes-Bolyiai University Computer Science Faculty.


Basic functionalities (functional requirements):

-User management: CRUD operations (to advance more quickly, I suggest reading these users, initially from a CSV file and then from a Databade implemented in PostgreSQL).
-Management of friendship relationships between users: adding/removing a friend.
-Determining the community to which a certain user belongs (the connected component of the network that contains the respective user).
-Message management: sending/deleting a message.
-Adding an object of type Page.
